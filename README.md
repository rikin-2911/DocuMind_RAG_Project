## 🚀 Overview
**DocuMind** is an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application designed to make working with documents smarter, faster, and more interactive.

With **DocuMind**, you can:
- 🔍 **Ask** questions directly from your uploaded documents
- 🧠 **Understand** complex context using intelligent retrieval
- ✍ **Summarize** lengthy files into concise, actionable insights

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features
- **LangChain** – for LLM orchestration and chain building
- **FAISS Vector Store** – high-performance semantic search
- **OpenAI LLMs & Embeddings** – for deep semantic understanding
- **Prompt Engineering** – well-structured prompt templates
- **JSON-based Prompt Format** – for flexible, reusable task definitions
- **Document Chunking** – split large documents for efficient processing
- **Information Retrieval** – accurate, context-rich answers
- **Streamlit** – intuitive and interactive user interface

---


## ⚡ Workflow
- Upload Document (PDF, TXT, etc.)
- 2.Chunking & Embeddings – document is split and converted into vector embeddings
- 3.FAISS Search – retrieve the most relevant chunks based on user query
- 4.LLM Response Generation – context is passed to OpenAI LLM via LangChain
- 5.Display Results – answers or summaries rendered in Streamlit UI

---


## NOTE: “This project is currently designed to run locally due to API usage constraints. Users can provide their own OpenAI API key to execute it.”


---

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- **Multi-file document support**
- **Support for local LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mistral)**
- **Multi-language summarization & Q&A**
- **Export answers and summaries as PDF**

---

## ✨ Tagline
- DocuMind – “Ask. Understand. Summarize.”
-Because your documents should talk back to you.
